# surplus on wheels

surplus on wheels (s+ow) is a pure shell script to get your location using
[termux-location](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-location), process it through surplus, and
send it to messaging service or wherever using “bridges”

surplus was made to emulate sending your location through the iOS Shortcuts app, and surplus on
wheels complements it by running surplus automatically using a cron job.
(but using it manually also works!)
